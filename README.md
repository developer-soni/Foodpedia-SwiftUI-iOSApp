### Description

Hello Everyone,

Presenting to you is “Foodpedia”, an app to Solve The Trivial Situation of Deciding What To Cook and Eat At Home. It is an ingredient based recipe searching app. Our app offers the most simple and easy to use UI, users just have to provide some ingredients and our app will provide them recipe based on those listed ingredients. This give them a lot of variety to choose from. 

Currently our app doesn’t focus on multi device though it works great on any iPhone. In our app we have used SwiftUI, which is to share Data very easily all across the app environment and let SwiftUI makes the necessary changes, guided by our code. We are making a network call which is getting back a JSON from API. We then pass the selected ingredients in the URL parameters. It returns the recipe back in a JSON format. 

The recipe result page shows data from an array of recipes obtained through a fetch call, which is then displayed using a controller view. 


Other tools used: Spoonacular API, Figma

### Whats next?

In the future, we plan on adding several other features to this app: 
  - A login feature for users to archive their favorite recipes.
  - A search function for users to select ingredients, as opposed to going through a list of ingredients and checking each box.
  - A wider range of recipes to search through.
