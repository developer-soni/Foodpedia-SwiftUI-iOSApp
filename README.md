## Description
Presenting you is “Foodpedia iOS App”.
### An app to Solve The Trivial Situation of Deciding What To Cook and Eat At Home.
It is an ingredient based recipe searching app. Our app offers the most simple and easy to use UI, users just have to select some ingredients and our app will provide them recipes based on the selected ingredients. Currently our app focuses on iPhones only. We have utilized Swift, to share data easily across the app environment and let SwiftUI makes the necessary changes. We pass the selected ingredients in the URL parameters to make a network call for a REST API (Spoonacular API). The recipe result page shows data from an array of recipes obtained (JSON format) through a fetch call, which is then displayed using a model controller view architectured screens. 


### API used
* Spoonacular API 

## Features 
- List of ingredients page

## Whats next?
In the future, we plan on adding several other features to this app: 
- A login feature for users to archive their favorite recipes.
- A search function for users to select ingredients, as opposed to going through a list of ingredients and checking each box.
- A wider range of recipes to search through.
